I woke up early this morning thinking to myself, "man, I'm so hungry!".  I 

headed to the kitchen to find some food but as soon as a leapt out of my bed, 

I heard a loud crash!

The sound was so loud that it made the nocturnal pet of the house sprint 

rapidly down the stairs to its safe shelter.  

Being the curious person that I am, I cautiously

walked out of my room with utmost stealth to check on the source of the sound.  
My hunger totally slipped my mind as I crept down the dark and creepy hallway 

towards the living

room in which I determined to be the location of the source of the loud crash 

that I've heard earlier.  

My heart was beating so loud and fast.  I got to the destination in the house 

and sure enough, I found evidence culprit.  I then realized that the intruder 

left a trail of dirt that headed straight into the basement, which was also 

where that naughty cat scurried off to hide.  Silly cat, scared me halfway to 

death.

The growling of my stomach reminded me of my 1st goal, to find food!  I 

thought to myself, "what should I eat?"  Opening the door to the fridge, I 

spotted some milk and decided to eat cereal!  What a great late night meal 

that was.  

I decided that since im up anyways, might as well eat more!  I ate so much 

that night that later on during the morning, I didn't feel hungry at all!  

What a great day this is going to be...right?
